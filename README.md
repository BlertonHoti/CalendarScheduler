# CalendarScheduler
Working Calendar Scheduler

This is a working Calendar Scheduler
To work first go on data base folder connect with data base
and then open the source code change all the constring of data bases 
and then open and it should work you will get a calendar when you click the date inside the calendar
a add event will pop up you can add events and then a counter in middle of a date will pop up thats the counter
of events and when you click the counter on the bottom left you can see events of that date in more detail
and also by selecting events you can change or even delete those events.
Btw is still work in progress because it does need some more work.
